# Nunjucks Starter

A simple nunjucks starter to create static websites efficiently.

## Gettings started

```
gulp dist
```
This command will compile the nunjucks files and scss files from sources/pages into /pages.

```
node app.js
```
This command will create a server to serve all the static files from /pages. Although it is not required, you can simply create an Apache Server in /pages folder.

You are free to modify the gulpfile to handle js files as well. 

## Contributing
